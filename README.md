GDScript: Classes (nodes) use PascalCase, variables and functions use snake_case, and constants use ALL_CAPS

tl;dr on syntax  
#comment, ignored by compiler  
func creates a function, any virtual methods is prefix by _underscore and you can make it 'prviate' so to speak by adding underscore at the start as well.  
@ means annotation  
static typing is your best friend, either by doing -> for functions or colon : for variables to make it easier for debugging issues.
